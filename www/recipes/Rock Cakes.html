<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Self-raising Flour
</li>
<li>
Caster Sugar
</li>
<li>
Baking Powder
</li>
<li>
Butter
</li>
<li>
Dried Fruit
</li>
<li>
Eggs
</li>
<li>
Milk
</li>
<li>
Vanilla Extract
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Directions:</h2>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Preheat oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and line a baking tray with baking parchment
</li>
<li>
Mix the flour, sugar and baking powder in a bowl and rub in the cubed butter until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then mix in the dried fruit
</li>
<li>
In a clean bowl, beat the egg and milk together with the vanilla extract
</li>
<li>
Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients and stir with a spoon until the mixture just comes together as a thick, lumpy dough. Add a teaspoon more milk if you really need it to make the mixture stick together
</li>
<li>
Place golfball-sized spoons of the mixture onto the prepared baking tray. Leave space between them as they will flatten and spread out to double their size during baking
</li>
<li>
Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden-brown. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for a couple of minutes then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool.
</li>
</ul>
