<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Butter
</li>
<li>
Caster Sugar
</li>
<li>
Eggs
</li>
<li>
Self-raising Flour
</li>
<li>
Milk
</li>
<li>
Lemon
</li>
<li>
Mixed Peel
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h2>Directions:</h2>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease an 18cm/7in round cake tin, line the base with greaseproof paper and grease the paper
</li>
<li>
Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating the mixture well between each one and adding a tablespoon of the flour with the last egg to prevent the mixture curdling
</li>
<li>
Sift the flour and gently fold in, with enough milk to give a mixture that falls slowly from the spoon. Fold in the lemon zest
</li>
<li>
Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and lightly level the top. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 30-40 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean
</li>
<li>
Remove from the oven and set aside to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn it out on to a wire rack and leave to cool completely
</li>
<li>
To serve, decorate the cake with the candied peel.

</ul>
