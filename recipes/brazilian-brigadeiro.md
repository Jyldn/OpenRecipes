Description:
A famous and delicious brazilian dessert which is present in every brazilian birthday party! Delicious and super easy to make.

Ingredients:

- One can of condensed milk.
- Three or four spoons of chocolate powder or cocoa powder.
- One spoon of butter (actual butter pls, no margerine!)

Instructions: 
1. Add all the ingredients into a pan
2. Put it under low heat and stir it (preferably with a wooden spoon) it until it starts sticking to the bottom of the pan
3. Remove it from the pan and eat it however you want!

Closing remarks:
Depending on how much brigadeiro you want to do, you'll have to add more or less of each ingredient, so be creative! Be careful with the chocolate powder, you definitely do not want to add too much of it!

People usually roll it down into multiple small brigadeiro balls, but I personally prefer to eat it with a spoon!
