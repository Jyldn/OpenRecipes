## Introduction
This repository hosts https://www.openrecipes.xyz. It's a recipe site without ads or trackers, just simple HTML and CSS. We don't care about your life story or what this recipe means to you. People come to this site for one reason and one reason only: To quickly find a recipe. 

## Upload a new recipe
Anyone can upload a recipe, just keep it under a megabyte. Submit a pull request with your recipe to the <a href="https://github.com/Jyldn/openrecipes">Github</a>.
Alternatively, submit your recipe to <a href="mailto:submit@openrecipes.xyz">submit@openrecipes.xyz</a>.
Feel free to include your own donation links in your submissions. Who knows, someone might really like the recipe.

## Donate
I don't make any revenue form this website. Donate to support open-source, bloat-, ramble-free recipes (once there's content here).
