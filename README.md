## Introduction
This repository hosts https://www.openrecipes.xyz. It's a recipe site without ads or trackers, just simple HTML and CSS. We don't care about your life story or what this recipe means to you. People come to this site for one reason and one reason only: To quickly find a recipe. 

## Compiling markdown to html
Install `sbcl` from your package manager.
Run `make` to compile all the markdown files in recipes/ to html files in www/recipes

## Upload a new recipe
Submit your recipes in the markdown format given in recipe/example.md.


Anyone can upload a recipe, just keep it under a megabyte. Submit a pull request with your recipe to the <a href="https://github.com/Jyldn/openrecipes">Github</a>.
Alternatively, submit your recipe to <a href="mailto:submit@openrecipes.xyz">submit@openrecipes.xyz</a>.
Feel free to include your own donation links in your submissions. Who knows, someone might really like the recipe.
